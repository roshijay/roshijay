# Hi, I'm Roshini Jayasankar

I'm a data scientist and Harvard Data Science graduate student focused on using AI/ML for meaningful, impactful solutions. While my primary focus is in healthcare, I'm open to exploring and contributing in other fields as well. I specialize in developing real-time anomaly detection systems and applying natural language processing to support diverse populations.

 **Projects I've built:**
- [PULZ-AI Social Trend Analyzer]
   – A metadata-based predictor of social video virality using Streamlit + BERT.
- [Autism Behavioral Clustering]
   – Unsupervised learning to track early developmental trajectories.
- [ICU Anomaly Detection]
   – Time-series ML to detect life-threatening events from patient vital signs in real time (95% accuracy).
- [ASD Emotion Classification]
   – BERT-based NLP to identify emotions in autism-related text, adapted for neurodiverse language.
