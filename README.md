# Hi, I'm Roshini Jayasankar

I'm a data scientist and Harvard Data Science graduate student focused on using AI/ML for meaningful, impactful solutions. While my primary focus is in healthcare, I'm open to exploring and contributing in other fields as well. I specialize in developing real-time anomaly detection systems and applying natural language processing to support diverse populations.

**Projects I've built:**
- [PULZ-AI Social Trend Analyzer]  
  A metadata-based predictor of social video virality using Streamlit + BERT.
- [Autism Behavioral Clustering]  
  Unsupervised learning to track early developmental trajectories.
- [ICU Anomaly Detection]  
  Time-series ML to detect life-threatening events from patient vital signs in real time (95% accuracy).
- [ASD Emotion Classification]  
  BERT-based NLP to identify emotions in autism-related text, adapted for neurodiverse language.

### Technical Experience

#### Programming & Data Manipulation  
Primarily work in **Python**, with additional experience in **R** for statistical modeling and **SQL** for querying and designing databases.

#### Applied Machine Learning  
Built and evaluated supervised models for classification tasks (e.g. ICU event detection), as well as unsupervised approaches like clustering for behavioral analysis. Projects involved **time-series modeling**, **dimensionality reduction**, and ensemble methods (e.g., **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**). Models were validated using metrics like **ROC AUC**, **F1 score**, and **cross-validation**.

#### Natural Language Processing  
Used **transformer-based models** such as **BERT** and **DistilBERT** to analyze text data, especially in contexts requiring sensitivity to neurodiverse communication patterns. Work includes **text classification**, **tokenization**, **NER**, and using word vectorization techniques like **TF-IDF**.

#### Data Engineering & Pipelines  
Developed interactive ML dashboards using **Streamlit** and built lightweight data pipelines for preprocessing and real-time monitoring (e.g., anomaly detection systems). Strong experience with data wrangling using **pandas** in Python and **dplyr** in R.

#### Databases & Modeling  
Designed normalized relational databases for project needs, including ER modeling and optimization. Comfortable with both schema design and query writing in **SQL** .

#### Visualization & Communication  
Created visualizations with tools like **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly** in Python, and **ggplot2** in R.  **ethical data storytelling**, especially when working with health-related or neurodiverse data. Coursework in **business rhetoric** strengthened technical-to-nontechnical communication.

#### Libraries, Tools & Platforms  
Hands-on with **scikit-learn**, **Hugging Face Transformers**, basic **TensorFlow**/Keras models, and statistical packages like **caret** in R. Projects managed with **Git/GitHub** and developed in **Jupyter**, **RStudio**, and **VS Code**.
