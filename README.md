# Hi, I'm Roshini Jayasankar

I'm a data scientist and Harvard Data Science graduate student focused on using AI/ML for meaningful, impactful solutions. While my primary focus is in healthcare, I'm open to exploring and contributing in other fields as well. I specialize in developing real-time anomaly detection systems and applying natural language processing to support diverse populations.

## Projects I've Built

- [**ICU Real- time Anomaly Detection**](https://github.com/roshijay/Anomaly-Detection-in-ICU)  
  A real-time Kafka-based system that processes 4,000 + ICU patient records and alerts
  life-threatening anomalies in vital signs using rule-based detection and clinical feedback- inspired
  prioritization.
     - Streamed 4,000+ patient records using Kafka producer-consumer architecture
     - Detected anomalies in vital signs (Pulse, SysBP) using customizable threshold-based rules
     - Ranked alerts with a recommender system that simulates clinician feedback adaptation
     - Achieved near real-time latency (~1s) between data ingestion and alert display
     - Developed a modular, ML-ready pipeline for easy integration with predictive models

*Earlier versions achieved 95% accuracy using traditional ML models;
current version emphasizes interpretability and real-time deployment readiness.*

- [**PULZ-AI Social Trend Analyzer**](https://github.com/roshijay/PULZ-AI)  
  A metadata-based predictor of social video virality using **Streamlit** + **BERT**.

- [**Autism Trajectory Clustering**](https://github.com/roshijay/Autism-Traectory-Clustering)  
  Unsupervised learning to track early developmental trajectories in children with autism.

- [**ASD Emotion Recognition**](https://github.com/roshijay/ASD-Emotion-Recognition)  
  BERT-based NLP to identify emotions in autism-related text, adapted for neurodiverse language patterns.

## Technical Experience

### Programming & Data Manipulation  
Proficient in **Python**, with additional experience in **R** for statistical modeling and **SQL** for database querying and design.

### Applied Machine Learning  
Developed and evaluated supervised classification models (e.g., ICU event detection) and unsupervised clustering algorithms for behavioral analysis. Expertise in **time-series modeling**, **dimensionality reduction**, and ensemble methods like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**. Models validated using **ROC AUC**, **F1 score**, and **cross-validation**.

### Natural Language Processing  
Used transformer-based models such as **BERT** and **DistilBERT** for text classification, tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), and emotion detection—tailored for neurodiverse communication patterns.

### Data Engineering & Pipelines  
Built interactive ML dashboards using **Streamlit**, and developed lightweight data pipelines for real-time monitoring and preprocessing. Strong experience with **pandas** (Python) and **dplyr** (R).

### Databases & Modeling  
Designed normalized relational databases using ER modeling and SQL optimization techniques. Skilled in both schema design and query construction in **SQL**.

### Visualization & Communication  
Created visualizations with **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, **Plotly**, and **ggplot2**. Emphasized **ethical data storytelling** in healthcare and neurodiverse contexts. Coursework in business rhetoric refined my ability to communicate technical insights effectively to non-technical audiences.
